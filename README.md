In abstract mathematics class of my penultimate year of highschool I accidentally rediscovered the Vandemonde matrix and Lagrange polynomial interpolation in an attempt to make a Valentines gift.

Developed and programmed in CASIO BASIC on a CASIO fs-9860G AU graphing calculator.

- BAUCRYPT.ctf : main entry point
- BIPDECPT.ctf : decryption entry
- BIPENCPT.ctf : encryption entry
- BRIDGE.ctf : original valentines program
- BTPL05.ctf : 5 char encoding routine
- BTPL08.ctf : 8 char encoding routine
- BTPL10.ctf : 10 char encoding routine

Yes, I know that it's not encryption, it's encoding, but I'm presenting the files as I wrote them 13 years ago.
